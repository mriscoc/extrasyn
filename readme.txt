ExtraSyn
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package contains about many highlighters for SynEdit, such as ruby, haskel, 
eiffel, fortran, modula 3, CA-Clipper, prolog, cobol, gnuplot, etc. 

This work is forked from the original work at:
https://gitlab.com/freepascal.org/lazarus/lazarus/-/issues/18248.

There is a runtime and designtime package: compile the runtime package 
(extrahighlighters.lpk) and install the designtime package
(extrahighlighters_dsgn.lpk).

There is also a test application that creates and loads the highlighters. 
Some of them do not provide sample code and will not show anything in the
test application.
